### env-config ###
A simple bash script that install plugin managers + some TMUX and VIM config files to simplify my env needs across platforms and machines!

*PLEASE* ensure you have Vim, tmux, libcurl, NPM, and NodeJS!

this can be done simply by doing:
$ "package manager" "install" curl tmux vim npm nodejs


Also note: Oh-My-Bash colors are *very* finnicky! You might have to adjust your terminal presets to get the colors to work well! Refer to the documentation.
